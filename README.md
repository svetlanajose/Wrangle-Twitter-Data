# Wrangle-Twitter-Data
Introduction
Are you a dog-lover? Have you heard about WeRateDogs? Probably not. But have you heard of
Twitter? Ofcourse you have! WeRateDogs is a Twitter account with over 6 million followers.
This account is for dog lovers to rate dogs and give hilarious comments about them. Most
people rate dogs, infact anything, on a scale of 10 with the rating actually less than 10.
However, WeRateDogs disagree and believe that most dogs deserve ratings of over 10, but on
10!<br>
This account has also received international media coverage for shutting down a person who
had issues with their rating system, in a humorous way ofcourse. But if you are a cat-person,
you might want to stay away! These guys are real damn serious about their love for dogs!
So after having analyzed their twitter data, I have gathered some interesting insights on the
following questions:<br>
❖ What are the 10 most common dog types?<br>
❖ What dog types are the highest rated and lowest rated?<br>
❖ Tweets of what dog types get retweeted and favorited the most?<br>
❖ Is there a relationship between favorites and retweets?<br>
❖ Is there a relationship between average rating and number of retweets?<br>
❖ Is there a relationship between average rating and number of ratings received?<br>
❖ What is the pattern of retweets and favorites over time?<br>
❖ Is there a relationship between dog type and confidence level of prediction on an
average? Which dog type predictions have a confidence level above 0.5 on an
average?
